# Database backed Celery Beat Scheduler

## Description
This is an sqlmodel based implementation of the celery beat scheduler.
I built this because celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler is not maintained and does not support ClockedSchedules.



## Acknowledgements
During the development of this project I used the following projects as reference:
celery-sqlalchemy-scheduler
django-celery-beat
celerybeatredis
celery
sqlmodel
